go-locust-client is a library to control a locust deployment and get statistics. This is client allows to start/stop a locust load test and ramp up load test.

Currently, go-locust-client requires Go version 1.13 or greater. I will try my best to test with older versions of Go, but due time constraints, I  haven't test with older versions.

This does not process client stats and presents information as it is.
